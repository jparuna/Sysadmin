The python script seems to have a problem with more then 300 connections, so I used: 


python dos.py 300

NOTE: The configuration is in the file itself, it is a quickly written script used test the number of network connections. 

If you want to go all out, you could do something like:
	for y in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do for x in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do python dos.py 300 & done ; done
